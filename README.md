# Background
Covid-19 virus is strongly speculated to have origins from China and transferred to humans sometime in late 2019. Due to the global interconnectivity of the world today and lack of government action the local outbreak in China quickly became a worldwide pandemic. The USA in particular has experienced bad outbreaks due to variety of reasons e.g. lax travel restrictions in the early months of the pandemic, lack of monitoring for symptoms of incoming people, lack of testing or PPE production during the early deays of the pandemic, and lack of coordinated federal response of US govt towards Covid-19. Additionally, mixed messaging and politicization of practical safety measures exacerbated the spread of the virus, as well as peoples general indifference toward something not directly impacting them. Throughout the year Covid-19 has been unable to be contained with each surge stronger than the last. The baseline heading into the fall was deemed quite high, about 4x higher than preferred levels, and widespread community transmission is now seen in almost all areas of the USA during late autumn/winter season. Due to these conditions its possible many companies or local governments are looking at strongly suggesting or limiting travel during the upcoming winter holidays e.g. Thanksgiving and Christmas/New Years or during 2021 prior to vaccine rollout. While some local governments strongly suggested not traveling for Thanksgiving there was no enforcement of this policy thus many people did travel home. Therfore it's even more prudent to monitor current Covid-19 trends be aware of current guidelines for travel, testing, quarantining etc and try to anticipate impacts on future activities. This project looks at Covid-19 data trends for Maryland and Montana using case incidence, death incidence, and other metrics to examine the current state of Covid-19 outbreak in selected states. It also retrospectively includes a look at the outbreak during July 2020 and attitudes toward masking at that time. The data shows that while they hadd apparently identical outbreaks in July, based on incidence, that currently the outbreak is in an upward trend in Maryland and apparent steep downward trend in Montana. While Montana has a downward trend its incidence still remains above Maryland. Some evaluation of the testing capacity  of each state (e.g. positivity rate) and other data shows practices are quite different between these two states and that this and other factors could be skewing the data - this is expecially the case for Montana. 

# Business/Personal Question
__What are recent Covid-19 virus data trends in regions of travel (Maryland and Montana) and what impact might be some impacts of deciding to travel over the winter holidays?__

# Data Question - Open Data
Data may come from the below sources:
1. __New York Times Covid-19 Data - US Counties and States__: The New York Times provides Covid-19 data, both live and historical, for the Covid-19 epidemic occuring within the USA + territories during year 2020. Data is available on national, state and county level and available data has been tracked since the epidemic started in January. This data comes from reports from state and local health agencies. Due to shortages of tests that were available the data may not reflect full extent of epidemic.
  i. The data used will be historical data. This data does not include results from current day but does include results up to current day. There will be no distinction made between probable cases and/or lab confirmed cases. US state level data can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv) and county level data can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv). 
  ii. __New York Times Covid-19 Data - US mask survey__: NYT commisioned the company Dynata to do a survey on mask usage in time period between July 2nd - July 14th. Survey asked "How often do you wear a mask in public when you expect to be within six feet of another person?" Survey received 250k responses from around the USA. Survey was only collected once. The survey results were weighted by age, gender, and approx location est. by zip code. Estimates of mask wearing were taken by doing a weighted average of the nearest 200 people, with people closest receiving more weight, this was then rolled up to county level data. The raw data for this survey can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/mask-use/mask-use-by-county.csv).
2. __Press releases from state and local authorities__: These posts will be sourced from government websites or local websites where the executive orders or briefings are made available. The City of Baltimore Executive orders can be found [here](https://www.baltimorecity.gov/executive-orders), Maryland state press briefings can be found [here](https://governor.maryland.gov/coronavirus/), newest exectute order issued on 2020.12.16 from Governor Hogan was found [here](https://governor.maryland.gov/2020/12/17/home-for-the-holidays-governor-hogan-announces-new-travel-orders-180-million-more-in-economic-relief/) updates on status of reopening in Montana can be found [here](https://covid19.mt.gov/joint-information-center), and information on Butte, MT can be found at county level by looking at Silverbow county data [here](https://www.co.silverbow.mt.us/2167/COVID-19).
3. __Technical Definitions__:The data is organized geographically by Federal Information Processing Standards [FIPS](https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/ansi/ansi-codes-for-states.html) State Numeric Codes. In this case we are concerned with Maryland (FIPS - 24) and Montana (FIPS - 30). [County level](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/home/?cid=nrcs143_013697) FIPS data is available here. This allows the analyst to look at specific regions of travel e.g. Baltimore City (considered county equivalent), Silverbow County (Butte, MT).
4. The __original files__ can be accessed on google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rKtZsGXOTT6L4-ZWdq6700KK3pvCxFl2?usp=sharing), and the edited files can be found within the Google Collaboratory notebook or for the pie charts and shp files found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NJJ4fea5WFnoxFsdX5esbeFy03691sMj?usp=sharing). Links are open access. 
5. Covid-19 Testing sites found from using Google map search and [MT Covid-19 testing sites](https://covid19.mt.gov/Montanas-Testing-Information)
6. __United States Census Bureau__ Data used for state map shapes, cartographic boundary files from year 2018, can be found [here](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.2018.html). For county level a JSON type file should be used, not done in this analysis, but can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/geojson-counties-fips.json)

- __What has the previous month's trend been in terms of covid cases?__ This will look at daily cases at state level to see whether the region is entering danger zone and look at daily cases, 3-day-average,and [incidence](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/global-covid-19/SARS-CoV-2-Transmission-Metrics.pdf) defined as "the occurence of new cases of a disease over a specified period of time" and mathematically defined as ((number of new cases of disease during specified period)/(by size of population at start of period)) * 100,000 gives you cases per 100,000 population. By using incidence can compare different regions. The population size is based on census data last taken in 2010 found here for [Montana](https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-28.pdf), [Maryland](https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-22.pdf). The data from NYT is reported in terms of __cumulative__ cases so daily difference must be taken to get daily new cases. Sometimes a person is later reclassified to different county, state etc so this explains a decrease in cumulative cases over time that may occur throughout data. 
- __What is the previous month's trend for deaths?__ This will look at daily reported deaths, 3-day-average, and 3-day-incidence to provide idea about whether state/county health agencies are in danger of being overwhelemed.The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provides state level data on this [here](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-estimated-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-state). 
- __What have been the previous month's recommendations from Governor or Mayor?__ This will provide an idea of how proactive government agencies are being at handling pandemic and allow for travel/post travel plans to be made so that the spread of Covid-19 can be limited and travel can be conducted safely or with minimized risk.
__Retrospective look at cases in July 2020 and attitudes toward mask usage then__ This may provide some insights into culture of the travel destinations and possibly reason for current status of outbreaks in each place.

# Data Answer
## Trends in daily covid cases and deaths for MD and MT
First the daily covid cases for past 30 days were examined for Maryland and Montana. This provides some surveillance of the landscape we're going to potentially be interacting with. Maryland and Montana have vastly different population sizes with Maryland population estimated as 6 million while Montana population is estimated as ~ 1 million. Th land masses are also quite different with Maryland being about 8.5% the size of Montana indicating high differences in population density. 
Maryland daily cases have been relatively steady.  However new daily record number of cases has been seen in the last 30 days, typical cases per day is about 2500.The 3 day cases incidence has stayed between 30-55 with most recent data showing 3-day incidence of 40.The 3-day death incidence is rising quite a bit up from about 0.2 per 100k a month ago to about 0.9. For Montana daily cases, 3-day incidence, and 3-day incidence have been trending downward. These are good signs but an active outbreak is still occuring in the state. Daily cases are down from ~ 1400 to ~ 800, 3-day incidence down from a staggeringly high 120 cases per 100k to ~ 50, and 3-day death incidence may have fallen though its to early to say whether its a downward trend or just a break in reporting. 3-day death incidence seems to be down from 1.4 to ~ 0.6 though its consistently risen to 1.4 week after week in the past 30 days. This suggests some uneven/delayed reporting.

![alt text](https://github.com/ijohns29/Data-visualization-of-Covid-19-for-mainland-USA/blob/main/MT_Covid_data.JPG)

Based on incidence trends here both states are in the red zone since their level is > than 25 daily new cases per 100k people. Maryland has been in the red zone for a month, while Montana has maintained its status as deep red over the course of the past month. Current outlook is that community transmission will continue to be an issue in both states. According to the CDC, the 3-day incidence number can be used to determine whether illnesses in the area are increasing, decreasing, or stable. Depending on the incidence level its possible to know the threat level of the region with [classifications](https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/key_metrics_and_indicators_v4.pdf) as follows: green (< 1 daily new case per 100k), yellow (< 10 daily new case per 100k), orange (10<25 daily new case per 100k), and red (> 25 daily new case per 100k). Choropleth graphs below for MD and MT help provide a visualization of the course of the Covid-19 spread over the past month. Note that the scale maximum is not based on the above classifications but based on the values of incidence between these two states so that a direct comparison can be made between current trends and also past trends in July, shown below in the mask survey section.

## Results of mask survey for Baltimore, MD and Silver Bow County, MT - July 2020
A retrospective examination of 3-day case incidence for Montana and Maryland were done and mask usage was examined for Baltimore and Silver Bow County. The results, shown below showed that during that time period both states had similar outbreak levels. Incidence rose from single digits 5-6 cases per 100k to about 16 over the course of the month. Survey results showed Baltimore City residents were much more likely to wear a mask with respondents indicating they wore a mask always when outside and around people 73% of the time, while for Silver Bow county this number was only 50%. Perhaps more concerning were the number who said they wore a mask rarely or never. For Baltimore City the number of people who never wore a mask was 2.4%, and rarely (assumed less than 20% of the time by study) was 3.2% while in Silver Bow those numbers were 15.8% (never) and 13.8% (rarely). That's a staggering difference in attitude. While the populations and sizes of each dates are quite different, as mentioned above, this appears to have not benefitted MT which should have had some advantages due to low population and massive size. This also holds true for the compared cities here. Baltimore has a population of about 620961 while Silver Bow county has population of 30093. Yet despite these differences Maryland currently has an incidence of about 40, a positivity rate of ~ 8% while Montana's incidence is closer to 50 and Silver Bows local positivity rate is ~ 16%. One caveat is that the testing situation is vastly different in these two states. Shown in a section below is testing sites in Montana vs testing sites just around Baltimore City. Additionally, many of the testing sites in MT have restricted access. This indicates outbreak reporting is likely being underreported and true toll is far worse. A choropleth visualization of the outbreak in July is shown below for each state. While there is no visual change in color one can see that the outbreak in each state has significantly worsened since then. This is due to a number of factors: (1) mask usage, (2) colder weather, (3) pandemic fatigue, (4) travel for holidays, and other factors.

## Additional data on Maryland region
Here we can see recent trends positivity rate for under and over 35 age groups as well as any changes in the state's testing volume over time. The data shows that both age groups saw slight increases in positivity rates though the younger age group's was slightly larger. This may be due to travel for Thanksgiving but is not necessarily the case. Positivity rate remains trending upward. It seems liley there may be actual enforced travel restrictions if the rate rises above 10%. Already there is Executive order to limit travel to essential purposes. The testing volume levels are fairly consistent across the month, with more tests typically processed on the weekend, whether this a result of more people being tested at the end of the week or due to something else is unknown. There was some surge in testing after Thanksigiving and last week, likely people getting tested prior to traveling.

## Airport Safety Precautions
1. Currently BWI airport has a number of administrative controls in [place](https://www.bwiairport.com/COVID19socialdistancing) to minimize spread of Covid-19. These include all restuarants at 50% capacity, social distancing and masks required, as well as various plexiglass installments at high traffic areas (e.g. security, airline counters, checkout lines etc.). Currently the government of the state of Maryland, and posted on the BWI [airport](https://www.bwiairport.com/COVID19socialdistancing) strongly discourages travel to areas with incidence equal to or greater than 20 per 100k.  
2. [BTM](https://co.silverbow.mt.us/2167/COVID-19) listed basic conditions such as mask wearing and hygiene but no other engineering controls were mentioned. They did include latest update on local Covid-19 status, local restrictions in place and most recent state goal i.e. getting 7 day incidence below 25 per 100k for two weeks.
The [Maryland Department of Health](https://phpa.health.maryland.gov/Documents/2020.11.10.03_MDH_Advisory_Large_Gatherings_Travel_Long_Term_Care_Visitation.pdf) recently issued guidance for travelers from Maryland. They recommended all Maryland residents returning from out of state get tested for Covid-19 within 72 hours of their departure from their out of state destination. Furthermore it is recommended they quarantine while awaiting their test results. Secondly, any Marylander who travels to state with Covid-19 rate greater than or equal to 20 per 100k (in past 7 days of their visit) should be tested and quaratine at home until results have been received. People should currently limit gatherings to < 10 people.   
3. Recent press releases from the Governors's office for Maryland indicate medical staffing are being surged in to bolster the increased hospitalizations resulting from increased cases and police and local authorities are engaged in movement to promote compliance with Covid-19 guidelines as well as penalize those who blatantly disregard them. The latest executive order says to limit travel to essential purposes and says all people who travel must quarantine for 10 days or get a negative Covid-19 test. Doctors recommendation from JHU is to get Covid test 5-7 days after whatever you deem your last exposure event to be e.g. flight etc or within two days of onset of symptoms. For MT there has been recent surge of nurses to support rural hospitals. But personell are limited due to simultaneous outbreaks all across the US.
# Business Answer
Using this data analysis the individual can examine regional trends regarding Covid-19 outbreak and assess the level of risk that the person may be subjecting themselves and others to during their travel. The person can consider potential impact on other stakeholders in their lives and plan accordingly. They should be aware of the need for caution during travel, all restrictions they may encounter, and have mitigation plans in place should they become sick. They should actively encourage the people they travel to do their best to adhere to proper safety protocols or to minimize risk to the extent feasible. The indivual should be strongly aware that the outbreak is likely to become worse in the coming months so travel situations school/company plans could change abruptly. There is also the possibility of stronger state government action. Organizational guidance regarding holiday travel can be found [here](https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/10/20/covid-19-winter-holidays/?mc_cid=295c6bc1e2&mc_eid=4aff72f931). Based on available data presented above travel is strongly discouraged within both states as Covid-19 incidence are in red zone for both departure and arrival states. Should travel occur the indivual should test before leaving and after arrival to destination, as well as upon return. The individual should quarantine at residence until results of testing are known suggesting travel for business is not recommended unless it will be an extended stay. It's strongly recommended that people traveling for business follow all local regulations regarding Covid-19 protocol and if local protocols are weak follow the stronger of the states within which they reside or travel too. For the latest updates there are a number of excellent dashboards by state governments and other independent sites that provide up to date data on each state e.g. [covid_actnow](https://covidactnow.org/?s=1458418). 
This project feeds in data much more smoothly than excel. Once the framework is built its very easy to update and grab the latest data and swiftly incorporate it into existing visuals and dataframes. With regards to improvements that could be made I should feed in more local data on Montana. I primarily included additional data on MD as it was easily accessible. In future I'd like to update the visuals more with county level data as well as a general outlook of the outbreak in the US as its a compelling visual. It could also be useful to show choropleths linked to CDC scale for USA and for extended time period e.g. 3 months. it could be beneficial to include hospital data to show the urgency with which the course of this pandemic needs to be changed. As mentioned previously typically less than 15% hospital capacity and there's some large concerns about the harsh restrictions being imposed in order to regain control and preserve public health system capabilities.
